# Level-function mapping
Level 1: **Implementation of Basic** **Sokuban** **Rules**

Level 2: **Internal Structures** 

Level 3: **Recursive Box1**(If go out of box A to B and find that the target point is a box C that cannot be moved, you should directly slides from A into C with the round position)

Level 4: **Multiple reference**

Level 5: the same as Level 3

Level 6: **Greedy Snake**

Level 7: **Recursion Overflow In**

Level 8: **Recursion Overflow Out**

Level 10: ???

Level 11: **Implementation of Basic** **Sokuban** **Rules**

 

`Todo`: **Recursive Box1**(If objects go out of the border of a box A, it will return to the box B that contains the box A, start from the position of A and move one step forward. If go out of Bâ€™sborder, recursively go out. If no box contains A, you should go into a default 5x5 empty space)
